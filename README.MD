# PyRow
-----

#### PyRow is a CSV to plain text exportation tool that reformats exported rows into a list of strings.

#### Why I made this.

I originally wrote this script to format output from a search engine keyword tool that displayed the estimated CPC based on search volume. I was doing it by hand through Google Docs before, but it was time consuming. As a programmer I thought why not make a script to do it for me!

Hopefully someone else could find this useful as well. :)

####TO-DO:
* **Make it more user friendly**:
		* Allowing user to specify which columns they want to take.
		* Allowing user to choose what they want to add to the output strings.
		* Build GUI for make it more friendly.

* **Can't forget reusability**:
		* Refactor code to make it easily importable into other projects.

Feel free to fork it or clone it to make it better! Merge requests also very welcomed.
